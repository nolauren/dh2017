# Assignment 2 - Topic Modeling 


The assignment is comprised of two components:

1. Topic Modeling Visualization
2. Written Response 


------------------

## Topic Modeling Visualization

Using an adapted version of the Signs@40 interface, build a site that visualizes your corpus. 
The corpus is an academic journal of your choice. The data should come from JSTOR's Data For Research (info below). 

The information for how to build the interface is available [here](https://github.com/statsmaths/dh-topic-models). Make sure to give descriptive names for the topics. 

Make sure to include a link to your site in your written response. It should be https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/dh-topic-models.


## Written Response

The 500-1500 word response should explain the data set, the initial findings, and how one would go about further exploring the data set/ findings/ arguments. It should  also address the following questions:

- Which data did you select for the corpus? Make sure to specificy the kind of data and periodization. 
- Why the number of topics? 
- What are the initial findings and/or possible arguments? In other words, what do these topics tell us? Certain patterns? Trends?
- Drawing on the readings, what are the possibilities and limitations of topic modeling?


More details:


- Citations: Use a modified format since citations will be drawn from course readings. Cite relevant readings using in-text/ parenthetical citations: (author, publication, date). Ex. (Blevins, personal blog, 09-09-2009) or (Goldstone and Underwood, JDH, 2012). 

- Save as "Assignment2_YOURLASTNAME.md" in your repository. 

- Grading: [Rubric](https://github.com/nolauren/dh2017/blob/master/assignment2_rubric.pdf)

## Corpus

### Jstor
[JStor Data for Research](http://about.jstor.org/service/data-for-research) provides machine-readable data from JStor, a digital library of academic journals, books, and primary sources.

### Downloading Data

It takes several days for Jstor to send the data. Make sure to make this request immediately. 
Visit [here](http://dfr.jstor.org). Set up an account and select your journal. 
One you have selected a journal, make sure there are at least 500 records to use; otherwise, we can't use topic modeling as there aren't enough records. There are two more categories to consider:

- Article Type: Pick the kind of articles you'd like to analyze. For example, one might only be interested in research articles or just book reviews. You can also do them all! 

- Year of Publication: You might consider just looking at a journal during a specific period. For example, did American Quarterly (the journal of  the field of American Studies) look at specific topics during the 1960s in the middle of the U.S. social movements?


Select Data Type: "Citations Only" and "Word Counts" and Output Format: "CSV".  

If the data has more than 1000 records, there are two options. 
You can make several requests to capture all the data or you need to select a subset. 
If you do not, you will get a random generated subset from JStor. Do not use a random subset.
