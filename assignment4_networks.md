# Network Analysis Assignment 

## Part 1: Network
Build your network in R. Save images of your networks to include in your paper. 



## Part 2: Paper

The 500-1500 word paper should address the following:

- Describe the data you selected for your analysis. Assume the reader is unfamiliar with the data.
- Explain the questions/ arguments your network generate about your data.
- Drawing on the constraints, critiques and ideas in our readings, discuss the possibilitie and limits of network analysis as applied to your network and for network analysis generally. Make sure to cite the readers. 

## Data

You can build your own data set or use the Supreme Court data. 

### Supreme Court

Washington University in St. Louis assigned each United States Supreme Court case to a legal issue (ex. desegregation). Pick two or more issues and analyze.  The [code book](http://scdb.wustl.edu/documentation.php?s=1) lists the corresponding issue assigned [each issue number in the data set](https://github.com/introdh2016/response3_network/blob/master/ussc-31.zip).  In order to better understand this Supreme Court data, read []().

### Your Data

Want to use your own data? Go for it! 
See lab09_network2.md for instructions on how to build your data set.
Please create the data in google sheets and include the link in your paper.
